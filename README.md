# Interview-Questions

This is a general list of questions for any programming position. 

### Purpose
The aim of these questions is to get a considerable impression of a interviewee's technical abilities and behavioral fit.

When looking for a potential candidate I want to see someone who has programmed with purpose. Someone who has made mindful decisions when choosing technologies, and design patterns. Put simply their ability to articulate what they did and why they did it is incredibly important. 

### Audience 
I'm sharing these here for anyone who is interviewer looking for inspiration and to refine their process. 
But also for interviewee's who are looking to improve their answers in an interview. The sub-questions in each category should give you a good idea of how to talk about your projects, work experience, and education in a meaningful and intelligent way.

### Update
As I continue to interview new people I will refine and update these questions based on the effectiveness of their ability to screen and discern quality candidates.
